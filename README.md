## Design Achievement Description
After playing around with different shapes, I wasn't too sure what I could make because I don't have any javascript experience. However, the colors really reminded me of a certain album cycle of a group I'm a fan of so I tried to remake the cover of an album. The one I remade is called The Story of Light' Epilogue - The 6th Album. There's a lot of overlap of shapes, which meant I had to mess with the positions, overlap, and order of a lot of parts.
